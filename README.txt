Trundle is a 3-D platforming game developed using the Unity Game Engine. This is a demo version of the game 
whose full version is available on Steam. As so, this demo contains 3 levels including a tutorial level while
the complete game contains 15 levels.

Originally the game started as a college project but I have decided to complete and polish the game.

--- Instructions ---

Download the Trundle (Demo Version)_Data folder and the Trundle (Demo Version).exe file into the same directory. 

Run the .exe file and choose desired settings.

Click the Play! button.
