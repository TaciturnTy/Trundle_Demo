Trundle is a 3D platforming game developed using the Unity Game Engine. This is a demo version of the game 
which is still under development. As so, this demo contains 3 levels including a tutorial level while the 
completed game is expected to contain around 15 levels.

Originally the game started as a college project but I have decided to complete and polish the game.

The completed game is expected to be uploaded to Steam either for free or for the price of $0.99 before the
year's end.


--- Instructions ---
